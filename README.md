# Rain_Water_Management
It is nearly impossible to trace back to which civilization used the method of rainwater harvesting first, but evidence shows that the basic design of these systems often involved a large rock formed into a basin using clay and other rocks to seal it from leaking. And then, using different diversion tactics, water would be stored and used for drinking, washing, agriculture and more. There began to be issues with the historic way of collecting rain.
As civilizations grew, the cisterns would become more and more contaminated. This lead to the spreading of diseases since the modern technology was not available to remove bacteria. As countries became more developed, centralized water utilities began to sprout and became the primary source for all water needs. The age of rainwater harvesting has not reached its peak. Many farms continued to use rainwater cisterns for feeding livestock. And as technology developed in water treatment abilities, people started to use rainwater in their homes as the primary source of water yet again. 
Though Rain water is a lifeline there are lack of effective approaches in the current set up to conserve,store and re use the rain water and reduce water demand at source. The main objective of this task is to help the city managers to adopt the decentralized approach of waste water management.
